# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:
set
get
contains
keys
hash

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took a standard approach of writing tests before coding.
Big O:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

## API
set - 
get
contains
keys
hash
