# Stacks and Queues
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Challenge
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
I took a TDD approach and designed my tests before I wrote my code. It made it 1000% easier.
Big(O):
Space: O(n)
Time: O(1)

## API
Stack:
Pop
Push
Peek
IsEmpty

Queue:
Enqueue
Dequeue
Peek
IsEmpty
