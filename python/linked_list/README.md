# Singly Linked List
This is a code challenge to solidify skills on Linked Lists. The code tests creating a node class and linked list class and tests various functions i.e include, to_string

## Challenge
See Above

## Approach & Efficiency
For this, I wanted to make sure I furthered my skills in testing, so I made it a priority (even though it should always be one according to TDD). The testing made this way easier than not doing them and made me understand the importance of TDD

## API
### .insert 
  - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

### .includes 
  - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

### .to_string_revision
  - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
